This masterclass is designed to help learners understand and use Git and GitHub effectively in real-world development workflows. The session focuses on building strong fundamentals, eliminating common confusion, and developing confidence in managing code versions and collaborating using GitHub.

The masterclass begins with the core concepts of version control systems, followed by a clear distinction between Git (a local version control system) and GitHub (a remote repository hosting and collaboration platform). Participants will learn how to initialize repositories, track file changes, create meaningful commits, and push code to GitHub with proper branch and remote management.
